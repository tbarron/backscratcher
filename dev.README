This file describes how I manage development of backscratcher.

Directories and Files
(Starred entries are not in git)

    DODO.org*
        Where I keep track of what I'm doing and what I want to do next.

    LICENSE
        What the name says.

    MANIFEST.in
        Input to setup.py about what to include in the distribution package

    README.md
        Markdown source for README. Copied to README as part of installation.

    TAGS*
        Emacs tags file for navigating the source code.

    attic*
        A place to stick stuff I don't want in the package but I'm not
        yet ready to throw away.

    bin
        Backscratcher entrypoints -- scripts that can be called from
        the command line.

    bscr
        Where the .py files of package bscr reside.

    bscr/test
        Where the package tests reside.

    cmsg*
        A place to compose commit messages.

    dev.README*
        This file. It may wind up in git yet.

    dist
        Where setup.py puts generated distribution files.

    githooks
        git hooks provided with the repo. Run 'githooks/links' to
        manage the hooks:
            githooks/links make   - install the hooks
            githooks/links rm     - remove the hooks
            githooks/links show   - check the hooks

    nose.cfg
        Config file for nosetests.

    requirements.txt
        setup.py uses this to know what prereqs must be installed so
        backscratcher will work. 

    setup.py
        The standard python package management script.



Tests go in directory tests in a file called test_COMPONENT.py. 

To run the tests 

  green [-v] tests

To generate a distribution tarball

  python setup sdist

To install the package

  pip install dist/backscratcher-VERSION.tar.gz
  pip install .

To install a new one over the top of an old one

  pip install --upgrade dist/backscratcher-VERSION.tar.gz
  pip install --upgrade .

To uninstall

  pip uninstall backscratcher
