Converting to using distutils (i.e., setup.py). Code goes in bscr into
importable modules. Things I want to call from the command line go in
bin. Everything in bscr gets handled automatically because setup.py
sees bscr as a package, so we don't have to list individual modules.

Each "script" (i.e., command line callable) has to be listed by path
in the scripts argument. I bet we can put something in setup.py to
generate that list for us.

Tests go in directory tests in a file called test_COMPONENT.py. 

To run the tests 

  green tests

To generate a distribution tarball

  python setup sdist

To install the package

  pip install dist/backscratcher-VERSION.tar.gz

To install a new one over the top of an old one

  pip install --upgrade dist/backscratcher-VERSION.tar.gz

To uninstall

  pip uninstall backscratcher
