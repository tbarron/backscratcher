                            Backscratcher

"Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's
 personal itch."
  - Eric Raymond

This is a collection of small programs I have developed over the years
to take care of various tasks on the computer. Perhaps the one I use
most is 'tps' (turbo-ps), which lets me grep the output of ps with
strings rather than pids.

Another one I use a lot is fx (effects). It can do a number of tricks
to issue a command on each of a collection of files, even commands
that ordinarily only operate on a single file.


    align.py
        Read a sequence of text lines and align their contents into
        columns.

    ascii.py
        Display the ASCII collating sequence.

    calc.py
        Simple calculator/expression evaluator.

    chron.py
        Timer. Can count up (like a stopwatch) or down (like a kitchen
        timer).

    clps.py
        Command Line Password Safe. Stores (host, user, password)
        tuples in an encrypted file, can copy a password to the
        clipboard for pasting into a password prompt without
        displaying it on the screen. Mac-specific, since it uses
        pbcopy and pbpaste.

    dt.py
        Easy date arithmetic.

    errno
        Feed it a number from errno.h, get back the symbolic name and
        meaning, or vice versa.

    fab.py
        Poor man's make.

    filter.py
    
    fl.py
        File manipulations. Copy atime to mtime, mtime to atime; diff file
        against previous revision; revert file to previous revision; remove
        \r from a file (or add them); display all times associated with a
        file; make backup copy of a file; find unreadable files.

    fx.py
        Command line effects. Turbo xargs; structured batch renames; etc.

    hd.py
        Hexdump.

    list.py (list.pl)
        Set arithmetic applied to lists generated by Unix commands.
    
    mag.py (magnitude)
        2384192384283 -> 2.17 Tb

    mcal
        Display analog calendar in various formats.

    msh
        Start ssh with a control socket so that multiple sessions can
        piggyback over the same connection without repeated
        authentication.

    odx.py (odx.pl)
        Report the octal, decimal, and hexadecimal variants of a
        number.

    plwhich
        Which for the perl installation. eg., where does Data::Dumper live?

    ptidy
        Cleanup up emacs debris.

    pytool.py
        Generate python templates.

    replay.py (replay.pl)
        Run a command over and over and watch its output.

    rxlab
        Play with regular expressions.

    scanpath
        Where in my $PATH is foo?

    summarize.pl
        Apply "artificial ignorance" to a set of files.

    testhelp.py [deprecated -- remove]
        Testing utility routines.

    toolframe.py [deprecated -- remove]
        Easy launching for tool-style and simply python programs.

    tpbtools.py
        Utility routines.

    tps
        Turbo-ps -- find processes.

    truth_table
        Generate truth tables for an arbitrary number of variables.

    vipath
        Edit $PATH.

    wcal
        Wide cal. Three months side by side.

    workrpt.py
        Read my work log and generate a report.

    wxfr
        Bulk file transfer.

    xclean
        Remove emacs backup files (*~) and other debris left behind by work
        processes
 
You may notice that some of these are written in only perl while
others have a python version and some are only in python. I learned
perl first and used it alongside the tcl-based expect tool until I
discovered python and realized that it provides pretty much everything
perl and expect do in a single tool. I'm not a performance wonk, I
just want to get the job done, so I didn't worry too much about
whether python is as fast or efficient as perl. I just jumped in.

So now I'm in the middle of converting all these programs to python.

Even more recently, I have started using Perl::Expect. So now I know
that perl can do expect-type stuff, too.

Regression tests now live in directory test.
